# About
This project was created for CSCE-361 to serve a culmination of the semester's learning. It allows users to create or log in to a grocery service. From the grocery service, users can view items stored in a database, add/remove items from their cart, edit their account details, and checkout.
# Getting Started
* Run Grocery.sql (found under the sql folder) in SSMS to setup the Database Schema
* In the sln, navigate to the accessors, find ConnectionAccessor, change the connection string to match your database.
* On Windows, you can run the project in Visual Studio by just clicking the green play button
* On Mac, you can run the project/solution in Rider, Run the Database on Azure Data Studio, and host the Database using Docker.
